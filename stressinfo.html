    Stressed out, huh? What is it, too much work not enough time? Or could it be too much schoolwork? Or even 
    possibly too much pressure caused by great expectations? Stress could also be that feeling when you realize 
    you've been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Rickrolled</a>. Whatever it is, it could 
    lead to stress, which is not good. I'm pretty sure if you've ever been stressed, you have looked up "cures" 
    for stress, which I assume haven't worked, because you are here now. Anyways, in this article, I'm gonna try 
    and break it down for you.
</p>

<p>
    Well first off, stress can be broadly categorized into 3 types. We have <a href=https://patient.info/mental-health/stress-management/acute-stress-reaction#:~:text=An%20acute%20stress%20reaction%20occurs,after%20an%20unexpected%20life%20crisis.>Acute Stress</a>, <a href=https://www.neuropeakpro.com/understanding-your-stress-type-how-to-manage-it/#:~:text=Episodic%20acute%20stress%20occurs%20when,running%20late%2C%20and%20are%20disorganized.>Episodic Acute Stress</a>,
    and <a href=https://www.verywellmind.com/chronic-stress-3145104#:~:text=Chronic%20stress%20is%20a%20prolonged,work%20or%20by%20traumatic%20situations.>Chronic Stress</a>. Acute stress is a feeling of stress that is usually quite severe, but passes in some 
    time. Meanwhile, episodic acute stress is basically acute stress, but it keeps happening from time to time.
    And lastly, the worst type, chronic stress is a long and prolonged feeling of stress. It's like an annoying 
    mosquito buzzing in your ear that just won't leave you alone. Stress, in any form has a lot of harmful side
    effects. It can render your creativity, productivity, physucal growth, thinking process, cause early hair 
    fall and greying.
</p>

<p>
    So if you look up the word stress on Google, it says that stress is a feeling of emothional or physical tension.
    Now you must be wondering why stress can also mean physical tension. This is because mental stress can have 
    an impact on your body. Like aforementioned, stress can cause growth and hair problems, but it can also lead 
    to aches, cramps, headaches, shaking, and dizziness. Yeesh that's a lot. You should be lucky yoiu don't have 
    stress. Oh, you do? <u>That's</u> why you're here? I though it was to give me company because it's literally 
    4 in the morning for me. 
</p>

<p>
    RIght, the cure. Well, the first step is to find out the cause of your stress. Too much work? Take a vacation.
    The most effective way to deal with stress is to distance yourself from the factor of stress. You could go to
    therapy, but that's expensive, and if you did, you wouldn't have to come here and read me rant about how it's
    4 in the morning and I'm half asleep. Speaking of sleep, a good night's rest clears out all the toxins in your 
    brain, so sleeping better can help too. Exercising regularly and eating healthy can counteract the physical 
    effects of stress too. And then, of course, we have meditation. Medeitation calms the body, both physically and mentally
    (and spiritually, if you believe those sort of things), and is a great counter to almost all side effects of
    stress.

    Anyway, I hope this helps anyone, you guys have been great. Thank You, and imma go crash now.
