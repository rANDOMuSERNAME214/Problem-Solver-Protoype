                    Too stressed, nervous or scared before taking a major decision or doing anything, really? Well 
                    my friend, you probably have anxiety. Anxiety disorders are mental illnesses, like <a href="depressioninfo.html">depression</a>, but everyone 
                    experiences anxiety at least once in their life. Some definitely experience it more than others,
                    and anxiety attacks can get really severe.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Anxiety is a feeling of dread, fear, or unease, like when you don't have confidence in yourself, or if you don't believe
                    yourself to be good enough. Anxiety is very closely associated with self-doubt, though it's not just that.
                    Anxiety isn't just there, though. Before a generally stressful situation, maybe performing in front of a big 
                    audience, or taking a big exam, most people get anxious, it's only natural, but few have vert severe anxiety attacks.
                    Anxiety attacks can last up to ten minutes, and symptoms can include (<i>inhales</i>) overwhelming fear,
                    palpitations, hyperventilation, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, sense of choking, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, feelings of being detached from the world,
                    fear of dying, numbness or tingling in the limbs or entire body, chills or hot flushes.

                <p>
                    Anyways, handling anxiety is actually quite easy. People more prone to anxiety attacks generally
                    carry paper bags around, as breathing into a paper bag during a panic or anxiety attack, much like the movies,
                    helps regulate breathing during hyperventilation, which helps you calm down. Focussing on a fixed object
                    reminds you that the world isn't spinning and help you concentrate. If you notice someone else having an anxiety
                    attack, give them some water and some space. <b>SPACE. THEY NEED AIR, NOT YOUR SYMPATHY, COME ON PEOPLE, THIS IS
                    SIMPLE FIRST AID</b>. People with anxiety disorders shouls also take <b>physician-prescribed</b> medicine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that's all I have for today. Hope this helps if anyone needs this in a pinch, and hopefully y'all learned 
                    how to stop crowding around your friends having anxiety attacks. <b>JUST GIVE THEM WATER AND SCOOT, HOW HARD IS THAT TO 
                    UNDERS-</b> ok I'm gonna go now ta-ta!
