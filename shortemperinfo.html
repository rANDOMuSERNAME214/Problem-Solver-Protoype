        Anger issues? Finally, something I can relate to! Now, this might seem surprising, but I, your resident 
        funny guy, used to have a very short temper. In other words, i got my feelings hurt very easily and I used 
        my muscles to sort things out. Now, as you can probably tell, that's not good, and I'm all sorted out now.
        SO this article, instead of fuly being about "clinical cures" will also be explaining my own story.
        If you don't want to read my story, you can skip ahead two paragraphs.
    </p>

        Why do you get angry? For me, it was because I was both very easily annoyed, and, more importantly, I 
        got my feelings hurt a lot. So what did I do? Well... nothing, actually. Back in 2019, yes that's right
        in the good old days, I used to play sports with my fellow kids in my apartment complex. We played
        along fine, and all was good. Until that occasional day when barely anyone used to come down to play
        and we used to sit down and talk. Back then, my capacity  for taking a joke was zero, and it went even 
        lower when the person cracking the jokes was the annoying popular kid. I was one of the first kids in the apartment,
        yet whena kid with a foreign accent joins, he's the center of attention? Not just this, but we also used to rank
        popularity on how well you played sports. The second and third most popular guys were excelent at sports, while
        this other guy was closer to my level. Another thing was, with popularity, comes the impression that the world
        revolves around you, therefore if you can take a joke, anyone can. Because of this reason, they would insult 
        me freely, call me names and whatnot.

        That doesn't sound like much, but then you factor in the fact that I was an emotional kid, with easily hurt 
        feelings, strong arms, and access to deadly projectiles known as rocks. You can imagine what happened. I had these
        fits of rage quite often, but fortunately I never hit anyone in a sensitive spot. Then what happened? The virus.
        My school shut down early and I went to live with my grandparents across the country. I usually spent my summer
        vacation there, so I assumed we were going there for a couple months. If i had just stayed there for a couple months,
        I might have come back the same, but due to the virus, I came back <b>9 months later</b>. I had matured, and
        a large part of this was due to the fact that I was alone, with nothing but time and enough time to contemplate
        my life to find out the I could be better. So that's it, folks, lock yourself into your bedrooms for 9 months
        and contemplate life, and you'll be fine. Okay that's it now goodbye.
